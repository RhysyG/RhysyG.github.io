### The Brief
PickChamps approached us to create a Daily Fantasy Sports Product with a difference. If you’re not familiar with Fantasy Sports, it’s a build your own fantasy team from a sporting code, earn points based on an athlete’s performance, climb your way to the top of the leaderboard, and win real cash. PickChamps wanted to create a similar experience but with no salary caps, customized statistical predictions (picks) instead of overall performance, and head to head battles for athletes.

The key to the success of PickChamps was the Pick Builder. We had to create a fully customizable user interface where a user could easily play around with stats, players, and pick odds.

### The Solution
We decided to tackle the Pick Builder by identifying what we thought would be the most common user actions.

1. **Building the Pick.** As a first to market product we made sure to use clear labels with icons and have the statistical options appear in sequential order.

2. **Pick Tweaking.** We identified that after users finish the initial pick, they would most likely want to tweak the options quickly and easily to find the right odds.

3. **Confirmation.** Simply but importantly, we made sure to repeat the Pick to the user in plain ol’ english.

Taking in all of points above, we decided to use a single screen user interface approach to minimise back and forth clicks, and maximise the enormous flexibility of pick combinations.

Some of the others features included; Leaderboard “find me”. To speed up finding who is around you, how many points you need to beat your opponents, and how far off winning prize money by taking you to your personal position on the leaderboard. Quick Picks. Quick Picks were created for users who didn’t have a pick in mind or have time to create one. Using this feature allows you to choose from a list of randomised completed picks which you can put on in 3 clicks.
