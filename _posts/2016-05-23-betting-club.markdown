### The Brief
Betting.club wanted to create a **real world online betting experience.** The common punter is inherently social, however there was a big gap in the market for social functionality, leaving users to resort to third party tools like texting. Betting.club seized this opportunity and came to us to bring it to life. In tern we came up with a minimal viable product with a full sportsbook, and some **nifty social features.**

### The Solution

#### Connections (Friends)

To convenience social interaction, we built a fully functioning connections component for the platform. This was imperative to allow users to quickly and easily **share content** to a preconnected group of friends and build **sticky content** on the platform.

With a connections component in mind, we then analysed the most common social behaviors of a punter and came up with the following features.

#### Sharing Tips

Every punter loves a tip on race day, especially when the mail is good! We thought it was an absolute must to be able to **replicate one key aspect of social punting** and give users the ability to **send tips**.

#### Sharing Wins
The only thing better than winning is telling people you’ve won. This makes for a **great activity feed item** which in turn is a positive reinforcement from a business perspective to let users see **winning bets**.

#### Sharing Form

For the more advanced users who mark their form before a race day, Share Form lets you **share your knowledge** with your connections to guide them on race day. This builds great content for the site which **users come back for** and that can’t be accessed anywhere else.

#### Sharing Black Books

*“Have you seen anything worth backing lately?.”* “Get behind that filly in Race 6, it’s a gun!”. Every Punter has a trusty book of strong runners which is **great sharing content**. Share Black Books lets you share all your Black Booked runners with your connections to help them find a winner in a tough field.
