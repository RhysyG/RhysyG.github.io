Welpoy is a tech-enabled hiring app that takes the guesswork out of temporary recruitment. Pre-vetted, quality staff can be hired via our platform in minutes. Their technology reduces time to hire and manages payroll, so clients can focus on on-boarding.

## Problem 1

Traditional recruitment agencies is fraught with friction.
* Poor accessability to profiles for the employers
* Lots of back and forth during the shortlisting process
* Mis-communicated job briefs
* No transparent pricing
* Messy payment systems and invoices

We set out to turn these actions into a 100% online self service experience.

## Problem 2

Initial user onboarding was currently a concierge approach. Weploy was growing at a speed where customer experience consultants were not able to provide onboarding to new users invited to the Weploy app. While we made the app as intuitive as possible, through data driven insights, we still identified a gap in the learning or adoption of features.

We used Krystal Higgins Onboarding Compass framework for the onboarding strategy.

The next part of the execution was to add the sequencing logic.

	</li>
</ul>

## Problem 3

Employers were sending lots of ad-hoc emails to Account manangers to learn more about the employees, or wanting to get visibility on hiring behaviour.

As an experiment, we created two MVP features to handle these two types of scenarios. We established success criteria to be a certain level of engagement which we could monitor through a data analytics tool called mixpanel.

<img class="u-mb" src="/img/portfolio/weploy-mvp/pshot_dashboard.jpeg">

#### Inbox of employee updates

The inbox provided 3 common updates:
* Whitney Worker will be arriving soon
* Whitney Worker will be leaving soon
* Whitney Worker has completed her job
* Whitney Worker has just become available to hire

<img class="u-mb" src="/img/portfolio/weploy-mvp/pshot_updates.jpeg">

#### Insights

The insights feed provided 3 common insights:
* William Worker’s visa will be expiring in  1 month
* William Worker has been extended [3+ times] within the past 6 months
* William Worker has been in your organisation for 3 months

<img class="u-mb" src="/img/portfolio/weploy-mvp/pshot_insights.jpeg">

Unfortunately, due to low engagement, the features didn't pass the success criteria, and both features were removed from the product. However, this was a great precident to keep trying experiements, and know we aren't going to continually make the product bulky with unused features.
