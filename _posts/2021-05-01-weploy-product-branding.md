Welpoy is a tech-enabled hiring app that takes the guesswork out of temporary recruitment. Pre-vetted, quality staff can be hired via our platform in minutes. Their technology reduces time to hire and manages payroll, so clients can focus on on-boarding.

## The Problem

Weploy had been built 5 years before this redesign was proposed. Weploy was originally built by an agency who put together a basic MVP. The MVP had been cut and stretched in lots of different ways to grow past it's scalability. There was no strategic product randing in place to create an on-brand experience.

## The Solution

I was tasked to create a new product branding guide. I went through a series of workshops with the founders to create a brief.

1. Moodboard, generate ideas
2. Competitor landscape research
3. Define goals
4. Stakeholder buy-in

Weploy is a on-demand staffing platform that uses Material Design (Google) components and Material Theming to create a personalised, on-brand experience.

### Minimal aesthetic

Weploy uses a minimalist aesthetic, creating an experience where content and actions take the forefront of the user experience. In an industry thats filled with loud, over-mature products, Weploy's brand plays an important role in coming across simple and easy to use.

### Visual themes

Rounded corners are a visual theme in the Weploy app, and are used on various components and elements. They reflect the shape of the Weploy logo, and act as an extension of the Weploy brand.

### Overlapping sheets

The underlying theme of Weploy's interaction model is that of two overlapping sheets. The bottom sheet has the navigation and branding elements; and the top sheet has the main content.

1. Bottom sheet, 2. Top sheet

### Product architecture

The Weploy appâ€™s information architecture has a dominant dashboard structure. Most of the main features of the app will be used from the dashboard.

#### Navigation

Weploy uses different types of navigation for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

- Mobile places navigation items in the back layer of a backdrop component
- Tablet uses the top app bar for horizontal navigation
- Desktop uses a standard navigation drawer

### Colour

Weploy's colour theme is monochromatic, using light and dark variations of the primary colour Weploy cyan. Weploy's primary colour (Weploy Cyan 100) fills the back sheet, the front sheet is on white, and the dark Weploy Cyan 900 is used for typography and iconography. The secondary colour (Weploy Coral 700) is used for sparingly for illustrations and UI accents.

#### Colour theme

### Typography

Weploy's Typography uses Intro for headlines and Assistant for body copy. Assistant is highly readable and Intro can command a headline.

### Iconography

Weploy's iconography continues the visual theme using rounded corners

1. To create consistency, all of Weploy's icons share the same underlying grid structure. 2. A collection of Weploy's icons

### Illustrations

The Weploy illustrations set out to establish that our staff are professionals with experience, not just young energetic millennials. The scenes are based around the office in hiring/recruiting scenarios.
HR manager should feel like rockstars when using the Weploy app.
