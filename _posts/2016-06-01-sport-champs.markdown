Fantasy Betting just got ‘social’. SportsChamps is Australia’s and UK’s new way to play Fantasy Betting with your mates to win real cash. Enter the big public room, or simply create a private comp with your selected mates. Place your virtual bets, build your balance, and race up the leaderboard to see who’s the Sporting Champ.

### The Brief
The SportChamps team outlined their idea’s for a new product to take on the UK and Australian Fantasy Betting market. They wanted a product with increased social gameplay, more flexible  betting options, and a wider range of sports to hone your particular sports knowledge. We had to build iOS and Android Apps, Desktop Website, and an Admin Desktop Website.

### The Solution

#### Layout

We identified early that layout was going to be an important part to get right as we were dealing with core navigation, real and virtual cash balances, game mode navigation, and a full sportsbook.  We used contextual menu’s for the Apps and a sidebar menu for the desktop. This way for the App we could have the core nav and real balance in the parent view and the game menu and virtual balance in the child view.

#### Notifications

SportsChamps is rich with user functionality that would be a missed opportunity for a notifications component. Like all good Apps, notifications are vital to keep users informed and happy, and increase their returned activity on the platform. Just to name a few, some of the notifications include; competition invites, connection requests, competitions starting, ending, and resulting.

#### Social

To increase social gameplay we decided to add a friends/connections component to the platform. By adding this functionality you could then allow users to connect with mates, show platform activity, create private competitions easily, and chat during the game to increase the gameplay experience.

#### Prizebar

By using the other Fantasy Platforms on the market, we found there was a real lack of leaderboard position for winning prize money. After all, that’s the main reason why we play! We came up with a little horizontal bar graph that highlights the payout positions, shows where you are in relation, and displays the least amount of virtual cash you need to win a prize.
