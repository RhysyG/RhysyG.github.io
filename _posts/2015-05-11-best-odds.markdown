### The Brief
Best Odds required a series of **online advertising** assets to help assist a TVC used to raise brand awareness and promote the product.

### The Solution
A series of Flash and Gif banners were made in various sizes and lengths and used across a broad range of **advertising networks**. Facebook and Google advertising were also heavily used.
