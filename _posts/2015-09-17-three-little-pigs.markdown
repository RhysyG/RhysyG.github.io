### The Brief
3 Little Pigs came into contact to build **website sales** and **brand identity**. A new responsive website was to be created with an easier purchasing user experience, and a new logo design which expressed greater trust and reliability.

### The Solution

#### Website
Our first priority was to ensure the new website build was **responsive** from mobile to desktop. Next was the choice of an E-Commerce platform. Shopify, WooCommerce and Magneto were explored and **WooCommerce** was chosen for the main benefit of price.

On top of a traditional E-Commerce website, Account **Wishlists** and **One Click Add to Basket** functionality were added to aid the user experience.

#### Logo

3 Little Pigs wanted a new brand identity of **modern, trusting and of good quality.** The current logo expressed more of a discount/bargin type brand, a “Crazy John’s” so to speak. We used modern fonts and colors and tied in a little fun with the pig's tail to keep the brand from being too luxury.
