<div class="o-wrapper  o-wrapper--narrow  u-pt  u-pb+" markdown="1">

SMF Building and Construction are **quality registered builders** for new homes and renovations..

### The Brief
SMF Building required a **new logo** and **brand identity** for their new company They are all about professionalism, quality and trust.

### The Solution
The final version of the logo consisted of a simplistic, professional font “Proxima Nova” where the “M” from “SMF” had a little **play on words with house imagery.** Blue was used as the brand color which always has good associations to brands that are **trusting, calm, confident and safe.**
