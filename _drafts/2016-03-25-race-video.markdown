Racevideo.com is like **YouTube for Queensland Gallops.** Thoroughbred, Harness, and Greyhound race videos are available on over 20 venues across Queensland.

### The Brief
Racing Queensland needed an affordable solution for storing a multitude of videos for a growing number of venues around Queensland. **Wordpress was their prefered content management system** and three feeds were needed from different video sources. Each series of races were to be stored for up to one month.

### The Solution
We built a custom WordPress theme and used **WP RSS Aggregator** to scrap the feed sources. When the feed is hit, the RSS Aggregator turns the data into WordPress posts. The solution was **simple, affordable** and allows Racing Queensland to add new venues and videos.
