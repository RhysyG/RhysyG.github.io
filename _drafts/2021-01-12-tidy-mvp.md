Tidy is the workforce management app for the commercial cleaning industry. Tidy’s solutions help cleaning businesses manage multiple workers, sites, and all round daily operations.

## The Problem

Workforce management is an industry full of generic time tracking apps, domestic market suitability, and frankly, poor user experiences. They all create shifts, manage schedules, and track time and attendance. Most competitor software lack the intricate details needed from specific industries, which leaves customers wanting more. Tidy set out to make an impact in the commercial cleaning industry.

## The Solution

Using the KANO model of feature analysis on customer satisfaction, the product team built a combination of basic and performance attributes. This consisted of:

1. Criteria and concrete statements
2. Generate ideas
3. Pick a top 3, run market feedback research
4. Run feasibility
5. Decide

It wasn't until

1. Moodboard, generate ideas
2. Competitor landscape research
3. Define goals
4. Stakeholder buy-in

Tidy is workforce management software that uses design to create an on-brand experience with a data-driven aesthetic.

### Minimal aesthetic

Tidy uses a minimalist aesthetic, creating an experience where content and actions take the forefront of the user experience.

Tidy enables businesses to manage their own desk-less employees with ease. Their employees get an awesome app for accessing and documenting everything on their phone, such as shift management, proof of location (digital certificates), task checklists, and much more.

Tidy **Primary** **White**  symbolises clarity and freshness while **Secondary Black** gives Tidy a premium feel. The high contrast between data and the background colour make it easy to read component statuses, graphs and charts.

### Visual themes

The Tidy sparkle is the visual theme in the Tidy app, and is used on various components and elements. They reflect the negative space sparkle in the logo, and act as an extension of the Tidy brand.

### Product architecture

The Tidy app's information architecture uses a flow structure. A flow structure is a task-based structure, requiring screens to be accessed in consecutive order.

Tidy information architecture has a hierarchical structure, allowing users to look at operational data through a variety of categories. The dashboard overview provides the most general version of this category, with an individual shift being the most detailed category in the structure.

#### Content
Content is divided into sections related to workforce operations, such as schedule, attendance, and inspections. Tidy's dashboard operates as a hub to these sections.

#### Navigation

<div class="o-layout  o-layout--center">
	<div class="o-layout__item  u-1/1  u-1/2-lap-and-up">
		<p>On desktop and tablet, Tidy uses permanent drawer navigation. On mobile, temporary navigtation is used to optimise content realestate.</p>
		<p>Tidy navigation provides a permanent region to navigate between sections, while taking up little screen space.</p>

### Colour

Tidy's primary color is clarity white. It uses a grayscale color palette so that operational traffic light colours stand out and copy is easy to read without distraction.

#### Meaning

Colour can communicate the meaning of different UI elements. Tidy's traffic colours clearly communicate red = something's wrong, amber = be cautious, and green = positive vibes, nothing to worry about.

### Typography

Lexend fonts are intended to reduce visual stress and so improve reading performance.

### Iconography

Tidy uses Material Design’s rounded iconography to express the brand while focusing on icon recognition and functionality. Icon and text thickness grades are matched for a harmonious visual effect.
