TODO: Need an easy way to distinguish parts I did vs what they did.
With my folio items, is it better to give context to the work I did or just show the work I did?
I need an easy way to skip through just the parts I did.

Ticket Tournament is a knock-out game of survival for Sport and Racing that offers a mix of chance, skill, and big prizes

<small>Note: The client name has been changed due to NDA contracts and has been replaced with Ticket Tournament.</small>

## What are we trying to solve?

Ticket Tournament saw an oppurtunity to capitalise in a growing market for alternatives to traditional lotto and betting. Many Australians play gamified products like footy tipping and supercoach while also placing the occasional bet and buying lotto tickets. Using a combination of these popular products, Ticket Tournament sought to invent a new style of game to enter the market. Think footy tipping meets lottoland meets reverse raffles.

#### User Research

User Research was lead by Ticket Tournament. They used a combination of data from an existing product pivot, competitive analysis, and field testing in hotels and pubs using printed materials.

## Synthesise Research & Design Strategy

#### Synthesizing Research

<div class="o-layout  o-layout--center">
	<div class="o-layout__item  u-1/1  u-1/2-lap-and-up">
		<p>Through User Research, we found these key insights to move forward in the right direction.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Users enjoyed games like footy tipping and lotto because they were simple and didn't require much involvement</li>
			<li>Features like a leaderboard help with game competition</li>
			<li>Games played in a real world space which is the feature of the night, ie; Reverse Raffle, may be hard to translate into the digital space</li>
			<li>Holding and selling at the right time, like the stock market, can be the skillful part of a game</li>
			<li>Not showing upfront the actual chance of winning helps to sell tickets</li>
		</ul>

#### Personas

Unfortunately the client had outlined over 8 personas they wanted to cover, so we had to do our best sticking to the ones we thought were most important.

**Primary Persona:**
The Lotto player. Someone who wants to spend minimal time whilst having fun. They love the thrill of winning big prizes. They are interested in Sports and have played traditional Footy Tipping.

**Secondary Persona:**
The Casual Punter. This will be our Power user. They don't mind spending more time finding value and have bet on Racing and Sports.

#### Feature Prioritization (MVP)

While many features were discussed like trading, bidding, liking, we had to help steer the clients from turning the product into the next Facebook or Twitter with chat and hashtags. Finally, we established a minimal set of features that would meet the budget and users needs.

The list included the following features

* Display a list of public games
* Signup, Authenticate, Password Recovery
* Display a list of games entered
* Display Tickets
* Buy tickets
* Display a list of purchased tickets
* Leaderboard
* Chance of going into the next round

## Placement & Layout Design

#### Sketching and Testing

Gameplay testing was captured during field testing in hotels and pubs using printed materials.

###### The Task

The task was to complete five games of ten rounds with 20 players. This field test was Conducted by Ticket Tournament. It's very hard to simulate this type of gameplay with a one dimensional paper prototype. Luckily, Ticket Tournament translated well to a manual format. The games were conducted over a month with a note taker and selected user interviews during and post games.

###### The Results

The key insights that were passed to us were:

* Users are not that interested in future events, they are mostly interested in current, past and next.
* Being a round by round based game, users wanted to know about the chance to move onto the next round

Based on these insights, we altered our Sketch flows of the digital User Interface.
