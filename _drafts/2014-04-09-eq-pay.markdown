EQ Pay is a **payment management tool** for Thoroughbred, Harness and Ground Racing. EQ Pay makes sure that trainers and service providers get paid on time and in full.

### The Brief
EQ Pay is essentially like a payment gateway and needed a logo to reflect mainly **thoroughbred racing, trust and security.**

### The Solution
Using a Thoroughbred graphic as the focal point, a slick abstract circle was fitted to add a unique look to **easily identify the brand.** Blue was used as the brand color which always has good associations to other brands that are trusting, calm, confident and safe.
