Rhys Gregory is a designer specialising in **UX/UI Design, Web Front-End Development** and **Branding**.

### The Brief
To create a logo in a **monogram** style using the acronym letters of the first and last name. The letter R needs to be the prominent letter and the G secondary. The logo is to be **simple, professional** but show **creativity**.

### The Solution
After initial exploration, I identified that flipping the R created a G in the top loop only fully closed. Taking a section out of the loop then exposed the G and adding a slight fade to R stem further pronounced the G making the perfect **monogram**.
